# Compilation Errors Fixed

## Issue 1: Type Inference Error in UserController

### Error:
```
incompatible types: inference variable T has incompatible bounds
    equality constraints: dev.doomsday.suitX.model.User
    lower bounds: java.util.Map<K,V>
```

### Problem:
The `Optional.map()` method was returning `ResponseEntity<User>` but the `.orElse()` was returning `ResponseEntity<Map<String, String>>`. Java's type inference couldn't reconcile these two different types.

### Solution:
Cast the User object to Object when creating the ResponseEntity:
```java
// Before (ERROR):
return ResponseEntity.ok(user);

// After (FIXED):
return ResponseEntity.ok((Object) user);
```

This allows the method to return `ResponseEntity<?>` which can hold either User or Map.

### Files Fixed:
- `UserController.java` - Lines 40 and 82

## Issue 2: Deprecated Annotation in Notification Model

### Warning:
```
expireAfterSeconds() in org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.index.Indexed 
has been deprecated and marked for removal
```

### Problem:
The `@Indexed(expireAfterSeconds = 7776000)` annotation parameter has been deprecated in newer versions of Spring Data MongoDB.

### Solution:
Removed the deprecated parameter and added a comment explaining that TTL indexes should be created manually:

```java
// Before (DEPRECATED):
@Indexed(expireAfterSeconds = 7776000) // 90 days in seconds
private LocalDateTime expiresAt;

// After (FIXED):
@Indexed
private LocalDateTime expiresAt;
```

Added comment:
```java
// TTL index - notifications expire after 90 days (auto-deleted by MongoDB)
// Note: TTL indexes should be created manually or via configuration
// db.notifications.createIndex({ "expiresAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 0 })
```

### Files Fixed:
- `Notification.java` - Line 67

## How to Create TTL Index Manually

If you need notifications to auto-expire, run this command in MongoDB:

```javascript
db.notifications.createIndex(
  { "expiresAt": 1 }, 
  { expireAfterSeconds: 0 }
)
```

This creates a TTL index that will automatically delete documents when the `expiresAt` timestamp is reached.

## Build Status

‚úÖ **Compilation: SUCCESS**
‚úÖ **Backend Starting: IN PROGRESS**

All compilation errors have been resolved and the backend is now starting successfully.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Backend is compiling successfully
2. ‚è≥ Backend is starting up
3. üîú Test the profile endpoints once the backend is fully running
4. üîú Start the frontend and test the complete flow

## Testing Checklist

Once the backend is fully running:
- [ ] Backend accessible at http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Login and get JWT token
- [ ] Access profile page in frontend
- [ ] View profile information
- [ ] Edit and save profile changes
- [ ] Verify data persists in database
